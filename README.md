## Overview

This project involved the creation of an OMTG diagram to model the faculty of the university, followed by spatial data digitization using ArcMap. The data was then used to develop a navigation app and webmap for the faculty, as well as a StoryMap to present the history and evolution of the faculty spaces.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: OMTG Diagram Creation

- **Objective**: Create an OMTG diagram to represent the university's faculty spaces, capturing entities and spatial relationships.
- **Deliverable**: 
  - `OMTG.html`: Visual representation of the OMTG diagram for the faculty.

### Stage 2: ArcMap Implementation

- **Objective**: Implement the OMTG model using **ArcMap** to digitize the faculty spaces and establish table joins and relationships.
- **Deliverable**:
  - `ArcMap.zip`: ArcMap project containing digitized faculty spaces and related attributes.
  - **Tools Used**: Spatial joins, relational data matching the OMTG diagram.

### Stage 3: Web and Story Maps

- **Objective**: Develop a faculty navigation app and explore **ArcMap StoryMap** to showcase the history and evolution of the faculty.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `WebMap.txt`: Link to download the faculty webmap.
  - `StoryMap.txt`: Link to access the StoryMap detailing the faculty's construction history.

## Folder Structure

- `/`: Project root folder containing the following files:
  - `OMTG.html`: OMTG diagram representing the faculty spaces.
  - `ArcMap.zip`: ArcMap project with the digitized faculty model.
  - `Presentation.pptx`: Project presentation.
  - `Report.html`: Project report (in Portuguese).
  - `WebMap.txt`: Download link for the faculty webmap.
  - `StoryMap.txt`: Link to the StoryMap detailing the evolution of the faculty.
  - `RESTURL.txt`: Related REST URLs for accessing GIS services.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the use of GIS tools, from creating an OMTG diagram to implementing spatial data in ArcMap and developing web-based navigation systems. It also highlighted the use of StoryMap to document the history and evolution of a spatial layout over time.
